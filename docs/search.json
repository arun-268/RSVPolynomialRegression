In season 2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023, data collected is from October 1 to October 1 next year.\nHow an entry is made in data set:\nA case is defined by laboratory-confirmed RSV in a person who Lives in a defined RSV-NET surveillance area AND Tests positive for RSV within 14 days before or during hospitalization. Evidence of RSV infection can be obtained through several laboratory tests.\nVariables:\nIn the original data set, it has 8 columns which are described in below table\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nState\nRepresents the state name from which data was collected. Entire state means all 9 states considered in this dataset.\n\n\nMMWR Year\nRepresents Year\n\n\nMMWR Week\nRepresents week of that year. MMWR - Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, is prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\nSeason\nAs the data is collected between October to April, this represents the duration of the year.\n\n\nAge Category\nAge limit\n\n\nSex\nMale/Female\n\n\nRace\nBlack, White, American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islander people are categorized as non-Hispanic. Hispanic people could be of any race. If Hispanic ethnicity was unknown, non-Hispanic ethnicity was assumed.\n\n\nRate\ncalculated as the number of residents in a surveillance area who are hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV divided by the total population estimate for that area. [NCHS bridged-race population](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm) estimates are used as denominators for rate calculations.\n\n\n\nThe data was last updated on 17th November 2022. We have considered two sets of data, one with last 12 months of YTD data and another one with 24 months of YTD data for our calculations."

    "text": "2.3 Methods\n\n2.3.1 Why Polynomial Regression?\nIn simple linear regression algorithm only works when the relationship between the data is linear, suppose if we have non-linear data then linear regression will not be capable to draw a best-fit line and it fails in such conditions. Consider the below diagram which has a non-linear relationship and you can see the Linear regression results on it, which does not perform well and doesn’t come close to reality. Hence, we introduce polynomial regression to overcome this problem, which helps identify the curvilinear relationship between independent and dependent variables.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 How Polynomial Regression Overcomes the problem of Non-Linear data?\n\nPolynomial regression is a form of Linear regression where only due to the Non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables we add some polynomial terms to linear regression to convert it into Polynomial regression.\nSuppose we have X as Independent data and Y as dependent data. Before feeding data to a mode in preprocessing stage we convert the input variables into polynomial terms using some degree.\nConsider an example my input value is 35 and the degree of a polynomial is 2 so I will find 35 power 0, 35 power 1, and 35 power 2 And this helps to interpret the non-linear relationship in data.\nThe equation of polynomial becomes something like this.[9]\ny = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1x1 + 𝛽2x12 + … + 𝛽nx1n\nThe degree of order which to use is a Hyper-parameter, and we need to choose it wisely. But using a high degree of polynomial tries to over-fit the data and for smaller values of degree, the model tries to under-fit so we need to find the optimum value of a degree.\nIf you see the equation of polynomial regression carefully, then we can see that we are trying to estimate the relationship between coefficients and y. And the values of x and y are already given to us, only we need to determine coefficients and the degree of coefficient here is 1 only, and degree one represents simple linear regression Hence, Polynomial regression is also known as polynomial Linear regression.\n\nIn statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x). Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression. The explanatory (independent) variables resulting from the polynomial expansion of the “baseline” variables are known as higher-degree terms. Such variables are also used in classification settings[1]."

    "text": "1.1 Background\nRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was discovered in 1956 and has been recognized as one of the most common causes of childhood illness. RSV symptoms usually look like a common cold, but it can be serious, leading to bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia, especially for infants and older adults.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, RSV results in around 58,000 annual hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths among children under 5.[1] In most regions of the United States, RSV circulation starts in the fall and peaks in the winter. With mask-wearing and physical distancing for COVID-19, there were fewer cases of RSV in 2020. However, RSV cases began to increase in spring 2021 when safety measures relaxed with the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines. This year, RSV in multiple U.S. regions are nearing seasonal peak levels. [2] It is unclear to anyone where RSV will lead us, a reliable prediction model for RSV data is very crucial for policymakers to implement fast actions to curb the spread of the infection, and for public health professionals to understand trends in virus circulation, estimate disease burden, and respond to outbreaks.\n\n\nFigure 1.1 RSV-NET Interactive Dashboard | CDC"

    "text": "1.2 Literature Review\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection trend has gained many researchers’ concerns globally. Thongpan, Ilada etc. applied multivariate time-series analysis to show the possible prediction of RSV activity based on the climate in Thailand. [3] The other researchers tracked RSV through internet search engine data. Oren, Eyal etc. highlighted the use of search filters and domain adaptation techniques to assist in identifying spread of both local and more widespread RSV transmission where comprehensive epidemiological data is not easy to collect.[4] Manuel, Britta etc. applied logistic regression to develop a prediction model and developed a web-based application to predict the individual probability of RSV infection.[5]\nFurthermore, researchers are using different modeling approaches to predict the RSV trend. A research done by Reis, Julia etc. tried to built a real-time RSV prediction system using a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model in conjunction with an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and 10 years CDC data[6]. Bayesian stochastic susceptible‐infected‐recovered‐susceptible (SIRS) model was presented by Corberán-Vallet etc. to understand RSV dynamics in the region of Valencia, Spain. However, this continuous‐time deterministic model is not suitable when the initial number of infected individuals is small[7]. Leecaster, Molly etc. use simple linear regression to explore the relationship between three epidemic characteristics (final epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length) and exponential growth calculated from four weeks of daily case data. They find out exponential growth was correlated to epidemic characteristics[8]."
