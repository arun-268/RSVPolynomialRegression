## **Data Collection**

Clinical symptoms of RSV are nonspecific and can overlap with other viral respiratory infections, as well as some bacterial infections. Several types of laboratory tests are available for confirming RSV infection. These tests may be performed on upper and lower respiratory specimens.

The most commonly used types of RSV clinical laboratory tests are

-   Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which is more sensitive than culture and antigen testing

-   Antigen testing, which is highly sensitive in children but not sensitive in adults

Less commonly used tests include:

-   Viral culture

-   Serology, which is usually only used for research and surveillance studies

Some tests can differentiate between RSV subtypes (A and B), but the clinical significance of these subtypes is unclear.

Where we are retrieving the data? CDC

CDC has several research and surveillance platforms that focus on seasonal trends, clinical risk factors, rates, and demographics of patients seeking care for RSV-associated illness.

Participating laboratories report weekly to CDC the total number of RSV tests performed that week, and the number of those tests that were positive. Because reporting delays may be expected for some laboratories, data shown for the most recent weeks, in particular the most recent two weeks, may be less complete than others.

we can put 1)where we get the data, who and when and how people collect the data (from CDC web, they have descriptions) , data contains what part, what variables we are using (there are two tests here, for simplification, I think we can just use PCR test percent and numbers, otherwise we need to explain why those two tests results are might different. We can put two tests, just more work. What do you think) 2) what is polynomial, what formula it is, what the logics behind

## *Why Ploynomial Regression?*

In simple linear regression algorithm only works when the relationship between the data is linear But suppose if we have non-linear data then Linear regression will not capable to draw a best-fit line and It fails in such conditions. consider the below diagram which has a non-linear relationship and you can see the Linear regression results on it, which does not perform well means which do not comes close to reality. Hence, we introduce polynomial regression to overcome this problem, which helps identify the curvilinear relationship between independent and dependent variables.
