    "text": "1.1 Background\nRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was discovered in 1956 and has since been recognized as one of the most common causes of childhood illness. RSV symptoms usually look like a common cold, but it can be serious, leading to bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia, especially for infants and older adults.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, RSV results in around 58,000 annual hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths among children under 5[1]. In most regions of the United States, RSV circulation starts in the fall and peaks in the winter. With mask-wearing and physical distancing for COVID-19, there were fewer cases of RSV in 2020. However, RSV cases began to increase in spring 2021 when safety measures relaxed with the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines. This year, RSV in multiple U.S. regions are nearing seasonal peak levels and is filling hospital beds. [2] It is unclear to anyone where RSV will lead us, a reliable prediction model for RSV data is very crucial for policymakers to implement fast actions to curb the spread of the infection, and for health system to get prepared not to be overburdened, and for infectious disease researchers to conduct further researches.\n\n\nRSV-NET Interactive Dashboard | CDC"

    "text": "1.2 Literature Review\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection trend has gained many researchers’ concerns globally. Thongpan, Ilada etc. applied multivariate time-series analysis to show the possible prediction of RSV activity based on the climate in Thailand. [3] The other researchers to track RSV through internet search engine data. Oren, Eyal etc. highlights the use of search filters and domain adaptation techniques to assist in identifying spread of both local and more widespread RSV transmission where comprehensive epidemiological data is not easy to collect [4]. Manuel, Britta etc. applied logistic regression to develop a prediction model and developed a web-based application to predict the individual probability of RSV infection[5].\nFurthermore, researchers are using different modeling approaches to predict the RSV trend. A research done by Reis, Julia etc. try to built a real-time RSV prediction system using a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model in conjunction with an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and 10 years CDC data[6]. Bayesian stochastic susceptible‐infected‐recovered‐susceptible (SIRS) model is presented by Corberán-Vallet etc. to understand RSV dynamics in the region of Valencia, Spain. However, this continuous‐time deterministic model is not suitable when the initial number of infected individuals is small[7]. Leecaster, Molly etc. use simple linear regression to explore the relationship between three epidemic characteristics (final epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length) and exponential growth calculated from four weeks of daily case data. They find out exponential growth was correlated to epidemic characteristics[8]."

    "text": "Clinical symptoms of RSV are nonspecific and can overlap with other viral respiratory infections, as well as some bacterial infections. Several types of laboratory tests are available for confirming RSV infection. These tests may be performed on upper and lower respiratory specimens.\nThe most commonly used types of RSV clinical laboratory tests are\n\nReal-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which is more sensitive than culture and antigen testing\nAntigen testing, which is highly sensitive in children but not sensitive in adults\n\nLess commonly used tests include:\n\nViral culture\nSerology, which is usually only used for research and surveillance studies\n\nSome tests can differentiate between RSV subtypes (A and B), but the clinical significance of these subtypes is unclear.\nWhere we are retrieving the data? CDC\nCDC has several research and surveillance platforms that focus on seasonal trends, clinical risk factors, rates, and demographics of patients seeking care for RSV-associated illness.\nParticipating laboratories report weekly to CDC the total number of RSV tests performed that week, and the number of those tests that were positive. Because reporting delays may be expected for some laboratories, data shown for the most recent weeks, in particular the most recent two weeks, may be less complete than others.\n\nData : https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend.html\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/index.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html\nwe can put 1)where we get the data, who and when and how people collect the data (from CDC web, they have descriptions) , data contains what part, what variables we are using (there are two tests here, for simplification, I think we can just use PCR test percent and numbers, otherwise we need to explain why those two tests results are might different. We can put two tests, just more work. What do you think) 2) what is polynomial, what formula it is, what the logics behind\n2020 Nov to till now.\nDuration of the data collected?\nResearch and Surveillance Systems"

Hence, we introduce polynomial regression to overcome this problem, which helps identify the curvilinear relationship between independent and dependent variables."
