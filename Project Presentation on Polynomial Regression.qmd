## Introduction

To highlight our proposal of new statistical regression tool, Polynomial Regression Model, to investigate the dynamic of RSV in USA. Book on RSV Data Analysis using Polynomial Regression method

## Background

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was discovered in 1956 and has since been recognized as one of the most common causes of childhood illness. RSV symptoms usually look like a common cold, but it can be serious, leading to bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia, especially for infants and older adults.
