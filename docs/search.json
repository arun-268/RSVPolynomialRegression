    "text": "1.1 Background\nRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was discovered in 1956 and has since been recognized as one of the most common causes of childhood illness. RSV symptoms usually look like a common cold, but it can be serious, leading to bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia, especially for infants and older adults.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, RSV results in around 58,000 annual hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths among children under 5[1]. In most regions of the United States, RSV circulation starts in the fall and peaks in the winter. With mask-wearing and physical distancing for COVID-19, there were fewer cases of RSV in 2020. However, RSV cases began to increase in spring 2021 when safety measures relaxed with the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines. This year, RSV in multiple U.S. regions are nearing seasonal peak levels and is filling hospital beds. [2] It is unclear to anyone where RSV will lead us, a reliable prediction model for RSV data is very crucial for policymakers to implement fast actions to curb the spread of the infection, and for health system to get prepared not to be overburdened, and for infectious disease researchers to conduct further researches.\n\n\nRSV-NET Interactive Dashboard | CDC"

    "text": "1.2 Literature Review\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection trend has gained many researchers’ concerns globally. Thongpan, Ilada etc. applied multivariate time-series analysis to show the possible prediction of RSV activity based on the climate in Thailand. [3] The other researchers to track RSV through internet search engine data. Oren, Eyal etc. highlights the use of search filters and domain adaptation techniques to assist in identifying spread of both local and more widespread RSV transmission where comprehensive epidemiological data is not easy to collect [4]. Manuel, Britta etc. applied logistic regression to develop a prediction model and developed a web-based application to predict the individual probability of RSV infection[5].\nFurthermore, researchers are using different modeling approaches to predict the RSV trend. A research done by Reis, Julia etc. try to built a real-time RSV prediction system using a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model in conjunction with an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and 10 years CDC data[6]. Bayesian stochastic susceptible‐infected‐recovered‐susceptible (SIRS) model is presented by Corberán-Vallet etc. to understand RSV dynamics in the region of Valencia, Spain. However, this continuous‐time deterministic model is not suitable when the initial number of infected individuals is small[7]. Leecaster, Molly etc. use simple linear regression to explore the relationship between three epidemic characteristics (final epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length) and exponential growth calculated from four weeks of daily case data. They find out exponential growth was correlated to epidemic characteristics[8]."

Population-based surveillance is the active collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on a population in a specified geographic area.

Hospitalization rates show how many people in the surveillance area are hospitalized with RSV, compared to the total number of people residing in that area."

    "text": "2.3 About this Dataset\n\n\n2.3.1 How an entry is made in dataset\nA case is defined by laboratory-confirmed RSV in a person who:\n\nLives in a defined RSV-NET surveillance area AND\nTests positive for RSV within 14 days before or during hospitalization.\n\nEvidence of RSV infection can be obtained through several laboratory tests:\n\nMolecular assays, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nCommercially available rapid antigen detection tests\nSerology tests, or antibody tests (must be paired acute and convalescent specimens)\nImmunofluorescence antibody staining, including direct (DFA) and indirect (IFA) fluorescent antibody tests\nViral culture\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Calculating Hospitalization Rates\nTo calculate RSV-associated hospitalization rates, RSV-NET collects the following data from identified cases:\n\nAge\nSex\nRace and ethnicity\nCounty of residence\nDate of hospital admission\nDate of RSV test\nPositive RSV test result\n\nHospitalization rates are calculated as the number of residents in a surveillance area who are hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV divided by the total population estimate for that area. NCHS bridged-race population estimates are used as denominators for rate calculations.\nThe table below summarizes changes in surveillance populations and collection of clinical data by surveillance year. Because the surveillance areas and age groups included in surveillance have changed over time, trends should be interpreted with caution (see table below).\n\n\n\n2.3.3 What’s in this Dataset?\nEach row in the dataset is a laboratory confirmed RSV associated hospitalization. It has 8 columns which are described in below table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nState\nRepresents the state name from which data was collected. Entire state means all 9 states considered in this dataset.\n\n\nMMWR Year\nRepresents Year\n\n\nMMWR Week\nRepresents week of that year. MMWR - Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, is prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\nSeason\nAs the data is collected between October to April, this represents the duration of the year.\n\n\nAge Category\nAge limit\n\n\nSex\nMale/Female\n\n\nRace\nBlack, White, American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islander people are categorized as non-Hispanic. Hispanic people could be of any race. If Hispanic ethnicity was unknown, non-Hispanic ethnicity was assumed.\n\n\nRate\nRates presented by race and ethnicity are calculated using records wit known race. Those with missing or unknown race are excluded from specific estimates but are included in overall esitmates. Hospitalization rates are based only on those who had positive test results for RSV through a test ordered by a health care professional not all people hospitalized with respiratory illness are tested for RSV\n\n\n\nVariables Considered:\nOf the other available column values we have considered columns “MMWR Week” & “Rate” for our model. The data was last updated on 17th November 2022. We have considered two sets of data, one with last 12 months of YTD data and another one with 24 months of YTD data for our calculations."

    "text": "2.4 Methods\n\n2.4.1 Why Polynomial Regression?\nIn simple linear regression algorithm only works when the relationship between the data is linear, suppose if we have non-linear data then linear regression will not be capable to draw a best-fit line and it fails in such conditions. Consider the below diagram which has a non-linear relationship and you can see the Linear regression results on it, which does not perform well and doesn’t come close to reality. Hence, we introduce polynomial regression to overcome this problem, which helps identify the curvilinear relationship between independent and dependent variables.\nOne Year-to-date Data:\n\nTwo Year-to-date Data:\n\n\n\n2.4.2 How Polynomial Regression Overcomes the problem of Non-Linear data?\n[9]Polynomial regression is a form of Linear regression where only due to the Non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables we add some polynomial terms to linear regression to convert it into Polynomial regression.\nSuppose we have X as Independent data and Y as dependent data. Before feeding data to a mode in preprocessing stage we convert the input variables into polynomial terms using some degree.\nConsider an example my input value is 35 and the degree of a polynomial is 2 so I will find 35 power 0, 35 power 1, and 35 power 2 And this helps to interpret the non-linear relationship in data.\nThe equation of polynomial becomes something like this.\ny = a0 + a1x1 + a2x12 + … + anx1n\nThe degree of order which to use is a Hyper-parameter, and we need to choose it wisely. But using a high degree of polynomial tries to over-fit the data and for smaller values of degree, the model tries to under-fit so we need to find the optimum value of a degree.\nIf you see the equation of polynomial regression carefully, then we can see that we are trying to estimate the relationship between coefficients and y. And the values of x and y are already given to us, only we need to determine coefficients and the degree of coefficient here is 1 only, and degree one represents simple linear regression Hence, Polynomial regression is also known as polynomial Linear regression.\nPolynomial Regression is a form of Linear regression known as a special case of Multiple linear regression which estimates the relationship as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial Regression is sensitive to Outliers so the presence of one or two Outliers can also badly affect the performance."

    "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus has been gaining more and more attention since the hospitalization rate has been increasing dramatically while there is no vaccines available now. A reliable regression model will benefit us to better prepare for it.\nOur article has generated a model that has a well fit (multiple R square =0.9606 and RMSE=0.16) through polynomial regression analysis. Also, we compared the model based on the data with one year span with two year span, and found that using one year-to-date data could help to build a better model for predicting RSV hospitalization rates. Further researches might be conducted to find out if modeling according to one year-to-data is always better for the seasonal diseases, like RSV.\nFurthermore, 3 month future RSV hospitalization rates were calculated. If there is nothing to be done to stop the spread, the hospitalization rates in the next 3 months could be very high, even to 9."

    "section": "4.2 Limitation",
    "text": "4.2 Limitation\nFrom the polynomial regression approach, we know that it is very sensitive to the outliers. The current high rates might shift our model and affect the results. Second, polynomial may provide good fits within the range of data, but they will frequently deteriorate rapidly outside the range of the data. To gain a better accurate prediction, people need to repeatedly generate new models. Third, In order to model data with a complicated structure, the degree of the model must be high, indicating and the associated number of parameters to be estimated will also be high. This can result in highly unstable models. Other approaches might be applied combined with polynomial regression to attain a more stable model.\nFrom the aspect of the data collection, it only includes 58 counties in 12 states from 2018 to now, it might not give us the whole picture of how respiratory syncytial virus evolved and spread in USA. More data is needed to provide a better prediction."
