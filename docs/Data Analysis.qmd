### Problem Statement:

We have seen a dramatic growth of RSV cases this year, but there are not any articles founded yet to give prediction of the RSV cases now. Based on the previous researches and the curve of RSV data, we propose a new statistical regression tool---polynomial regression model --- to investigate the dynamic of RSV in USA.

#### Package Loaded:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
```

#### Load Dataset:

```{r}
data <- read_excel("/Users/arunraj/Documents/MS Data Science/Advance Statistical Modeling/Week1-Project/PolynomialRegressionArNa/NinaCode/RSVProject/RSVproject2022/RSV Data for the US.xlsx")
data %>% 
    head() %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling()

```

#### Data Preprocessing

The first thing that we'll do in data preprocessing is to check for missing values.

```{r}
colSums(is.na(data))
```

Our dat does not have missing values, which is good. If theres is missing value, we have to decide to impute the data or exclude the obsevation.

#### Removing outliers

Let's now take a look at the distribution of our data by drawing boxplots.

```{r}
data %>% 
   select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
   boxplot(main = 'Boxplot of parameters', xlab = 'Parameters', ylab = 'RepWeekDate')
```

```{r}
outlier_slag <- min(boxplot(data['PCRDetectionsnumerator'], plot = FALSE)$out)
data.outliers <- data %>% 
   filter(PCRDetectionsnumerator >= outlier_slag)
```

```{r}
data %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = RepWeekDate, y = PCRDetectionsnumerator)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_point(data = data.outliers, aes(x = RepWeekDate, y = PCRDetectionsnumerator), col = 'red') + 
    labs(
        title = 'Distribution of strength : normal vs outlier (red)',
        x = 'RepWeekDate',
        y = 'PCRDetectionsnumerator'
    )
```

#### Data Distribution:

```{r}
data %>% 
    select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
    pivot_longer(cols = -'Virus Isolation percent', names_to = 'param') %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
    geom_density() +
    facet_wrap(~param, scales = 'free_x')  +
    labs(
        title = 'Density graph of parameters',
        x = 'Parameters',
        y = 'Week Frequency'
    )
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=data,aes(x=RepWeekDate,y=PCRDetectionsnumerator))+geom_smooth()
```

#### *Why Ploynomial Regression?*

In simple linear regression algorithm only works when the relationship between the data is linear But suppose if we have non-linear data then Linear regression will not capable to draw a best-fit line and It fails in such conditions. consider the below diagram which has a non-linear relationship and you can see the Linear regression results on it, which does not perform well means which do not comes close to reality. Hence, we introduce polynomial regression to overcome this problem, which helps identify the curvilinear relationship between independent and dependent variables.

#### Structure of the assignment

1.  Load RSV dataset

2.  plot them in scatter plot/graph

3.  Ensure the data is nonlinear and hence we are moving to polynomial regression.

4.  prepare training and test data set

5.  construct a polynomial regression model and ploy them in a graph using ggplot function

6.  use K- means clustering to spilt the data to find which degree of polynomial suits our regression model.

7.  construct a polynomial regression model.

8.  Test the model with some values and find whether fall in the regression lines.

9.  Conclusion.
